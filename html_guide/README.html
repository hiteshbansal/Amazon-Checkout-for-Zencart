<h2 id="ReleaseNotes">Release Notes</h2>
<ol>
  <li>It is strongly encouraged to have your AWS key ready to enable 
    signed orders.  Unsigned orders are very vulnerable to fraud. You
    can setup your AWS key in http://sellercentral.amazon.com &gt;
    Integration &gt; AWS Access Key.</li>
  <li>Note that Checkout by Amazon standards do not allow weights of products to be 0 at this time.  Thus, a weight tag = 0 will be removed from the XML cart before the order is processed.
  </li>
  <li>The orders that are processed through Checkout by Amazon will
    appear in Zen Cart if you enable  order
    management. Currently orders that are not in shippable state are
    not displayed in the Zen Cart order management UI if IOPN endpoint is not set. For
    information on how to enable post order feeds, click <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help-page.html?ie=UTF8&amp;itemID=200303920" target="_blank">here</a>.    </li>
  <li>Checkout by Amazon plug-in allows you to calculate shipping rates (using shipping modules in Zen Cart) and tax rates dynamically when the order is being placed by the customer. You need to ensure that your desired shipping modules and right tax settings are configured in Zen Cart. The configured shipping modules and tax settings will be used to calculate tax and shipping rates via Callback. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>The price that is included in the XML carts sent to Checkout by
    Amazon from Zen Cart includes promotion prices set in
    Zen Cart, .i.e. the promotion has already been applied to the
    item.  If you, the seller, also configure promotions in Seller
    Central, these will be applied in addition to the promotion from
    Zen Cart.</li>
  <li>Please note that the SKU, Title, &amp; Description fields of products
    may be truncated when building the Checkout by Amazon cart.  This
    is to comply with the standards set by Checkout by Amazon.  Please<br />
    see the Checkout by Amazon documentation in &quot;LINKS&quot; section below.</li>
  <li>If you wish to create your own success return page and use the
    popup order summary from Checkout by Amazon, you will need to
    include the necessary scripts.</li>
