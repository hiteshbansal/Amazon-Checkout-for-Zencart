IMPORTANT: If you want to manage orders placed through Checkout By Amazon on your website, setting up the cron job is mandatory.

*/5 * * * * wget "http://mystore/checkout_by_amazon.php?action=Everything" -O /dev/null

This cron is required to keep your orders in sync with Amazon Seller Central Order system. 

Note: Some Hosting provider will not allow you to set cron run once in 5 minutes. In such case, please contact hosting provider for appropriate configurations.
